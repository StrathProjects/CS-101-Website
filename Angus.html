        Security and Privacy of COVID-19 track and trace systems
      </h1>
      <p class="para1">
        Different systems have been employed by various continents and
        countries. A few Asian countries have used phones to track the public
        who they think may have COVID-19 with no consent from the user. Whereas
        European governments have used anonymised IDs for users to track their
        movements, whilst the US are employing the same technology that an
        advertising company would use to track large gatherings of people (Abbas
        et al., 2020). This shows that depending on the laws, political
        standing, and consent of the people, there are multiple different
        applications with varying degrees of security that can be produced. This
        report will look at different models individually and all models as a
        whole to look in-depth at the security issues and potential solutions to
        some vulnerabilities.

        Due to the track and trace system requiring data of users and the other
        users around them. The English government put in place a system that
        kept the individual’s data safe through a random identification number
        instead of holding their name and other sensitive data. This data could
        not be seen by the government or the NHS for privacy and security
        reasons (O’Dowd, 2020). Through a random identification number (ID) this
        stops the availability for hackers to see the name of each person and
        where they live as the ID is completely disassociated with an
        individual’s details. This system creates trust with the general public
        as security is an important consideration for users, especially when
        such sensitive data about themselves could be potentially lost.

        There is however a concern over the ability to still see the phone type
        of a user in a specific area through Bluetooth. This technology could
        assist in the process of malicious reconnaissance that someone may carry
        out to identify a person (Magklaras, 2020). Bluetooth therefore has an
        inherit flaw where due to its design developers can check what devices
        are Bluetooth powered. This causes a security concern as potential
        hackers could abuse this power for reconnaissance purposes. As the
        public already fear government tracking, knowing that the COVID-19 app
        could assist in such a process could prevent potential downloads of the
        app resulting in less effective contact-tracing.
      </p>
      <p class="para2">
        Furthermore, the security and potential risks of contact tracing apps
        creates trust issues with the general public. A focus group study
        conducted by the journal “Health Expectations” concluded that a there
        was a major group of people with worries about their data’s security and
        privacy. Where the public were particularly concerned with the
        governments use of their data and believed that the app could be used as
        further spying for the government (Williams et al., 2021). The findings
        of this study show that an increase in public relations work is required
        to alleviate the misconceptions the public may have about app security.

        Apple and Google teamed up to use their technology to ensure secure and
        accurate contact tracing, as two reputable companies this could install
        a feeling of security in the public. Through their partnership they
        created an API (application programming interface) that would store only
        necessary data whilst continuing to prioritise people’s security over
        their private data (Burgess, 2020). By using trusted company’s such as
        Apple and Google this will instil more trust with the public and lead to
        an increase in downloads of the contact tracing applications. Thus,
        keeping possibly infected people in self-isolation and preventing the
        spread of Covid-19.

        The NHS X app has admitted it works with various big tech company’s such
        as Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and many more. This extensive
        use of industry outside of the governments public sector can create
        concern as the government need to rely not on themselves but on private
        tech-companies to follow the correct GDPR guidelines (Guinchard, 2020).
        As the contact tracing application is only effective providing there is
        multiple users on the NHS X app, the less trust the users have with
        various private-sector companies, the less people will download the
        track and trace application.

        As many of the worldwide contact-tracing apps require GPS permission
        this could cause concern for the user. Especially when the mobile
        network provider may not even ask for the users permission for their
        location to be tracked (Borra, 2020). Borra goes further in detail where
        she explains that these apps could potentially open opportunities for
        the government to increase their reconnaissance or even private-sector
        corporations using the data for advertisement purposes. As privacy is a
        basic human right, users should at minimum be given the option to be
        tracked with their own consent which many applications do not allow.
      </p>
      <p class="para2">
        The next study looked deep into the code that built 41 different
        contact-tracing applications to investigate the different private data
        that was collected for contact-tracing. The investigators found that
        there are privacy issues within a collection of the contact-tracing apps
        which they believe could be fixed. One of these possible exploits is
        that user ID’s are static whereas a system with greater security would
        include a system of ID’s that change regularly (Wen et al., 2020). Apps
        that don’t take the required time to update their security could be
        jeopardising their user’s data that should be as secure as possible
        especially when dealing with sensitive information such as location and
        distance from other users.

        The IEEE have advised applications should use a blockchain security
        approach to remove the security issues of a central database. This is
        due to the risks that come with a centralized system where applications
        like Google and Apples contact-tracing app, including many others could
        risk a “trajectory attack” where a user’s profile could be rebuilt from
        server data (Xu et al., 2020). It Is worrying that the end user’s data
        could again be targeted from a security issue. Even IEEE researchers
        could find a flaw yet two major private-sector company’s such as Google,
        and Apple fail to create a blockchain security approach.

        As the first track and trace systems to be employed were Australia’s
        CovidSafe and Singapore’s TraceTogether there were key lessons to be
        learned from such systems before various other countries developed
        theirs. The main problem with both apps is that they assume the end user
        is a healthy, English speaking individual whereas there are plenty of
        immigrants, children and disabled users that either cannot speak English
        or will struggle to operate the application (Abbas and Michael, 2020).
        The total disregard of those who may need assistance is why the initial
        apps failed to succeed. Whereas later applications learned from such
        mistakes and adapted their technology to suit multiple languages and
        provide accessibility.
