       The Use of Technology in Combatting the Social/Mental Health Impact of Covid-19
      </h1>
      <p class="para1">
        The outbreak of covid-19 forced people around the world to change the way
		they work, receive an education, and interact with one another. A big change
		to everyone’s lives due to the pandemic was the government-imposed 
		lockdowns, as well as outside of lockdowns people having to self-isolate
		in their homes at any point if they are in contact with someone infected 
		with the virus. People are informed if they’ve been in contact with anyone
		who has covid-19 by using track and trace, meaning it is always important
		to test yourself for covid if you show any symptoms so that you know to 
		self-isolate and so that people you’ve been in contact with are told as soon
		as possible, which will help stop the spread. But according to polling 
		performed by the UK government, “just 17% of people showing symptoms are 
		subjecting themselves to tests” (Stokel-Walker, 2021), which means that very
		few possibly infected people are finding out if they are infected; mainly due
		to being afraid of how a positive test result would impact them and their family. 
		The main reasons people fear a positive test result or being told they’ve been 
		in contact with an infected person, is that they would struggle to earn income 
		while isolating or that they could infect their family. If you test positive 
		you must self-isolate immediately, which results, in some cases, in not being 
		able to work, and for some people it is difficult to self-isolate due to 
		restrictive space in their home and concerns over multiple people having to
		share spaces like a bathroom or kitchen with the infected person 
		(Matukas, Dhalla and Laupacis, 2020).
      </p>
      <p class="para2">
		The need to share rooms in the home makes self-isolating from others in 
		your household or accommodation nearly impossible which increases people’s
		fears of infecting those around them. The other big fear from self-isolating,
		of losing income, is a big one, as not all people were eligible for 
		furlough pay if they couldn’t work from home, which could add to people’s
		stress and cause them to use their savings or take out loans to pay for 
		everyday necessities. This could also pile onto people’s pre-existing
		debt or money struggles.If you test positive, or you’ve been in contact 
		with an infected person, there is a massive fear for your health as well
		as the wellbeing of your family and others around you. This has caused a 
		large increase in mental health decline across the entire population and
		isn’t helped by “repeated media images of severely ill people, dead bodies
		and coffins” (Tsamakis et al., 2021, p.2) which has caused more fears 
		especially since people wouldn’t be able to say goodbye to sick or dying 
		loved ones. Increased levels of anxiety, panic and depression have all 
		stemmed from these fears, not to mention increase in loneliness due to 
		not being able to see friends or family while you’re isolating.

        During giant outbreaks like with covid-19, quite often the number 
		of people who suffer mentally far outweighs the number of people who
		were infected by the virus. This means that during crises like the pandemic
		there should be a large focus on mental health help as well as help with 
		virus treatment, but when the outbreak first began, covid-19 had interrupted
		or stopped “critical mental health services in 93% of countries world¬wide 
		while the demand for mental health is increasing” (Tsamakis et al., 2021, p.4).
		The mental health issues required a solution quickly before it got out of 
		control, thankfully as mental health was in decline countries were adapting 
		more to the virus, meaning they managed to come up with solutions to 
		the mental health problem. Many countries soon began to offer over the
		phone mental health help and consultation where face to face sessions
		were no longer possible. A large portion of people who had mental health 
		issues before the pandemic did start to use this service, and even people
		who only began having mental health struggles during the pandemic started 
		to go and get help, with “around one in five young people and one in six adults”
		(Mind charity, 2021, p.20) getting mental health help for the first time, 
		over the course of the pandemic, so it isn’t all negative.
      </p>
      <p class="para2">
        Sadly, given these new methods of receiving help and support for any
		mental health issues, “more than one in five (21%) adults and one in 
		seven (15%) young people” (Mind charity, 2021, p.20) didn’t seek help 
		with their problems because they didn’t think it was worth taking up 
		consultation time. This over the phone method was a great help for people 
		suffering with mental health problems but people also used other things 
		to try and improve their mental wellbeing. People have been using many 
		different forms to cope with lockdowns and isolation. Many have used 
		types of technology such as social media and zoom to stay connected 
		with friends and family, which has given people more contact with the 
		loved ones they can’t see face to face. Unfortunately, even with this 
		online connectivity many people think it hasn’t really improved their
		mental state, possibly due to the amount of covid-19 related information
		on the internet and social media. Because of the nature of online 
		information people can scroll endlessly through different videos and 
		articles on covid-19, which leads to a lot of confusion with the changing
		covid-19 info as well as more fear over the virus and what regulations 
		to follow (Garfin, 2020).

        Covid-19 has proved to be quite a challenge, but people have managed 
		to change and adapt how they do things and over quite a short period.
		People have begun using track and trace and doing tests to check if 
		they are infected and to notify others who they’ve been in contact with
		if they are. Some have swapped to working online, getting healthcare 
		support over the phone, and contacting family over zoom and social media
		if they’re isolating. The mental health of the public has experienced a 
		decline due to the covid-19 outbreak and issues it created, but the healthcare
		system has worked hard to combat this in a covid-19 safe way.
