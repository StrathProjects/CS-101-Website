        Varying Test and Trace Systems in Different Countries
      </h1>
      <p class="para1">
        The first system that will be discussed is the one built and developed in South Korea. It is widely regarded as a success partly due to the country reflecting on their poor reaction to the 2015 MERS outbreak (Beaumont and McCurry, 2020) and thus improving on how they react to nationwide outbreaks. In 2015, a law was passed in response to the outbreak which allows government agencies to follow the actions and footsteps of an individual through gathering information from credit card usage, mobile phones, and CCTV. (Lewis, 2020) This meant they could determine any people they could have given the disease to. The country started the construction of their system for testing only a few days after the first case of COVID-19 was identified in January. (Beaumont and McCurry, 2020) Following a local outbreak in Daegu, tests were being distributed in large numbers across many locations. Those who returned a positive test were requested to log the recent locations they had visited, and this data was then fed into a mobile app that would notify users if they were near the spot of a positive case. (Beaumont and McCurry, 2020) This app used in South Korea also made it possible to identify those who broke isolating rules which could lead to financial or prison sentences for those caught. (Moon et al., 2020)

        The second nation of focus is Germany and like South Korea, developed their test and trace system very early on in the pandemic. Overall, the system can be regarded as a success however at the beginning when it was first launched it faced several problems. It was built upon an already thriving healthcare foundation in the country and where Germany differs from the UK and many countries is the fact that the effort was not a whole country one and was more locally focused across the many local areas in the country. (Beaumont and McCurry, 2020) The main form of tracing is through the use of an app for your phone which takes advantage of Bluetooth technology. The app’s launch in June 2020 faced setbacks since the development of the app was changed from a whole government effort to a devolved one. This results in it being tough to measure the success of the app. (Moon et al., 2020)

        The system created and developed in the United States started off slowly and raised many concerns. The United States have performed the highest number of tests in the world however, this wasn’t the case for a large part of the beginning of the pandemic due to a slow reaction and the government maybe not taking the virus as seriously as they should have. However, the response sped up and tests are easily accessible for everyone. (Beaumont and McCurry, 2020) Third-party companies such as Google and Apple enhanced their Bluetooth system in their devices which resulted in an individual app not being needed to be created since necessary data on people’s whereabouts was able to be collected and distributed without one. (Parshley, 2020)

        The next country in focus is Singapore where like other Asian countries, such as South Korea, reacted well and set up a testing and tracing system as soon as possible to combat the spread of the virus. Singapore has two standout methods of tracing; one is a mobile app that uses Bluetooth technology to send alerts to users if they are a close contact of a positive test. Where Singapore has had some more initiative and creativity than other countries is when it comes to their second standout method which is portable Bluetooth tokens than can be worn on person for example, on a lanyard around your neck. This token can follow and log the movements of those wearing one. (Beaumont and McCurry, 2020)

        The final country of focus is Vietnam, and their response and system of test and trace has been widely viewed as a success. They make use of similar methods of surveillance to South Korea but also use additional data that is gathered through social media posts and location data on phones to check an individual’s steps and journey. In-person interviews are used involving contact tracers to gather information and the data gained from the surveillance techniques is checked against the information being told in these interviews. (Lewis, 2020) Once close contacts have been identified they are sent to isolation facilities if they don’t have the ability to isolate from others properly and they are asked to describe their symptoms which are then uploaded and shared. (Lewis, 2020)
